This is an extension of the [Noise protocol framework](http://noiseprotocol.org/) to make use of the [Strobe protocol framework](https://strobe.sourceforge.io/).

See [this discussion](https://moderncrypto.org/mail-archive/noise/2017/001122.html) for more information.

[A specification](specification.md) is currently being drafted for this extension.
