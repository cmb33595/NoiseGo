# Noise+Strobe=Disco

This is a merge of the Noise protocol framework and the Strobe protocol framework.

See [this discussion](https://moderncrypto.org/mail-archive/noise/2017/001122.html) for more information.

See an example of what a spec for Disco could be [here](disco.md). It's a modification of Noise's specification and is here only for PoC purpose.
